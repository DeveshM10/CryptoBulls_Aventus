button called Tools where you need to add features like

🧾 1. Bill Reminder Tool 🔹 Purpose: To help users stay on top of upcoming bills and recurring expenses (rent, electricity, mobile bills, credit card dues, etc.)

🔹 Key Features: Add/edit/delete bill entries

Set frequency: One-time / Monthly / Quarterly / Yearly

Set reminders: X days before due date (email, SMS, or in-app)

Mark as paid/unpaid

🔹 Data Structure Example: json Copy Edit { "bill_name": "Electricity Bill", "amount": 2200, "due_date": "2025-04-25", "frequency": "monthly", "reminder_days_before": 3, "status": "unpaid" } 💱 2. Currency Converter 🔹 Purpose: Converts currency values in real-time and optionally shows historical trends.

🔹 Requirements: Use a live FX API like ExchangeRate-API, Open Exchange Rates, or CurrencyLayer

🔹 Example: Convert 10,000 INR to USD at current rate of 1 USD = 83.2 INR

plaintext Copy Edit 10000 INR ÷ 83.2 = 120.19 USD 🔹 Optional: Show last 30 days trend using historical API endpoints (line graph or chart).

🧮 3. Tax Estimator (India FY 2024–25) 🔹 Purpose: Estimate Income Tax Liability based on annual income, deductions, and selected tax regime.

🔸 Step 1: Choose Tax Regime India has two regimes:

🅰️ Old Regime – with deductions like: 80C (₹1.5L max)

80D (Medical insurance)

HRA, LTA, Standard Deduction (₹50,000), etc.

🅱️ New Regime – No deductions but lower tax slabs. 🔸 Step 2: Apply Slabs 📌 New Regime Tax Slabs (FY 2024–25):

Income Slab Tax Rate 0 - ₹3,00,000 0% ₹3,00,001 - ₹6,00,000 5% ₹6,00,001 - ₹9,00,000 10% ₹9,00,001 - ₹12,00,000 15% ₹12,00,001 - ₹15,00,000 20% Above ₹15,00,000 30% 📌 Old Regime Slabs (Basic):

Income Slab Tax Rate 0 - ₹2,50,000 0% ₹2,50,001 - ₹5,00,000 5% ₹5,00,001 - ₹10,00,000 20% Above ₹10,00,000 30% 🔸 Step 3: Formula (simplified) plaintext Copy Edit Taxable Income = Gross Income - Applicable Deductions (only in old regime)

Tax = Slab-wise Tax Calculation + 4% Health & Education Cess 🔹 Example (Old Regime): plaintext Copy Edit Gross Income = ₹10,00,000 Deductions (80C, 80D, Std) = ₹2,00,000 Taxable Income = ₹8,00,000

Tax:

First ₹2.5L = 0 Next ₹2.5L @5% = ₹12,500 Next ₹3L @20% = ₹60,000 Total Tax = ₹72,500 + 4% Cess = ₹75,400 📈 4. Interest Calculator A. Simple Interest (SI) ✅ Formula: plaintext Copy Edit SI = (P × R × T) / 100 P = Principal Amount R = Annual Interest Rate (%)

T = Time (Years)

✅ Example: P = ₹10,000, R = 6%, T = 2 years

plaintext Copy Edit SI = (10000 × 6 × 2) / 100 = ₹1,200 Total Amount = ₹11,200 B. Compound Interest (CI) ✅ Formula: plaintext Copy Edit A = P × (1 + R/n)^(n×T) CI = A - P P = Principal

R = Annual Interest Rate (in decimal)

n = No. of compounding periods per year (monthly = 12, quarterly = 4)

T = Time in years

A = Final amount after interest

✅ Example: P = ₹10,000, R = 6% annually, T = 2 years, Compounded quarterly (n = 4)

plaintext Copy Edit A = 10000 × (1 + 0.06/4)^(4×2) = 10000 × (1.015)^8 ≈ ₹11,268.25 CI = ₹1,268.25 🧮 5. EMI Calculator 🔹 Purpose: Calculate monthly loan EMI and total repayment.

✅ EMI Formula: plaintext Copy Edit EMI = [P × R × (1 + R)^N] / [(1 + R)^N – 1] P = Loan amount (Principal)

R = Monthly interest rate = Annual Rate / 12 / 100

N = Loan tenure in months

✅ Example: Loan = ₹5,00,000 Interest = 10% per annum → Monthly Rate = 0.00833 Tenure = 5 years = 60 months

plaintext Copy Edit EMI = [500000 × 0.00833 × (1 + 0.00833)^60] / [(1 + 0.00833)^60 – 1] EMI ≈ ₹10,623 Total Repayment = ₹10,623 × 60 = ₹6,37,380 Total Interest = ₹1,37,380 these are examples you can take inspiration and maybe use this or add your own creativity,
